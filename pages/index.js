				Welcome to The Vault! <br><br>
				The Vault is Progress MFGâ€™s portal to access different applications throughout the company. Do you need to put in a suggestion for continual improvement or safety? Did you just catch a co-worker living the company values and need to submit an iPoint? Do you need to submit a request for time off, or IT helpdesk, or maintenance? If you need to do any of these things, you have come to the right place!<br><br>
				The Vault also has links to important websites and access to company tools.  <br><br>
